# Simple Gauss-Newton Optimization with Sophus SE(3)
This repository contains an implementation of a simple Gauss-Newton algorithm for nonlinear optimization, utilizing the Sophus library to handle Lie groups and transformations. The project aims to provide a clear example of applying the Gauss-Newton method to problems in robotics and computer vision where transformations are crucial.

## Introduction
The Gauss-Newton algorithm is a method used to solve nonlinear least squares problems. It is widely used in areas such as photogrammetry, robotics, and computer vision, particularly in problems involving the optimization of parameters on manifold settings provided by Sophus.
